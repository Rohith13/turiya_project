# Turiya Project

Turiya Project is a minimalist mindfulness web application designed as a quiet digital sanctuary.

Inspired by the Sanskrit concept of *Turiya* — the fourth state of consciousness beyond waking, dreaming, and deep sleep — this project focuses on simple awareness, stillness, and presence, without noise or pressure.

There are no accounts, no ads, no notifications, and no data collection.  
The experience is intentionally calm, respectful, and distraction-free.

## 🌿 Purpose

Turiya Project was created to explore how technology can offer moments of mindfulness without demanding attention or engagement.

It is not a productivity tool, habit tracker, or medical application.  
It is a gentle space to pause — nothing more, nothing less.
